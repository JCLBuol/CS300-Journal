What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  For the main project of this course we were working on analizing different data structures to store and access class information for a university.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  First I looked at the amount of data which was going to be stored and accessed.  Seeing that there was very little data involved in this project I knew that there      would not be a large impact by any particular data structure.  So knowing that performance would not be an issue on this particular project I then looked at which data structure would be the easiest to work with.
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I did not run into many roadblocks until the final project in this class.  Unfortunatly my entire family came down with covid which we had through the final 3 weeks of the term which made it very hard for me to find the time to work on the project and to fully focus on the work that I was doing.  This was something that I did not fully overcome and unfortunatly had a subpar effort for the final project.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I have had a very successful approach to working on software projects in the past.  However, this has shown me that I should build in a little extra time over what I have been curretnly doing in the unforseen event of a sickness or other challange coming up that takes away more time than I anticipated.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I have not really changed the way that I write programs.  I have always tried to keep my code as modular as possible to make them easy to read and maintain.
